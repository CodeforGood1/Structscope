# Struct Scope

Struct Scope is a local-first Visual Studio Code extension and command-line tool for inspecting memory layout in C, C++, and Rust. It parses source files, extracts struct-like definitions, computes ABI-aware field placement, and reports byte offsets, field sizes, alignment, padding, cache-line split risks, platform differences, and rule-based improvement guidance without invoking a compiler.

The project is designed for systems programming, embedded development, performance engineering, protocol design, and low-level code review workflows where object layout affects memory footprint, binary compatibility, cache behavior, or wire-format design.

## Capabilities

- Static analysis for C structs, C++ structs/classes with data members, and Rust structs
- ABI-aware layout computation for `x86_64`, `arm64`, `arm32`, `avr`, and `riscv32`
- Host ABI auto-detection with manual target-platform override
- Visual byte map with field regions, padding cells, and cache-line boundaries
- Field table with offsets, sizes, padding-after values, and cache-line notes
- Rule-based, local-only improvement guidance with severity, confidence, and safe recommendations
- Layout score and grade for quick prioritization
- Greedy field reorder suggestions with expected byte savings
- Platform comparison reports for pointer-width and ABI-sensitive structures
- VS Code diagnostics for padding hotspots, high-waste structs, and cache-line split fields
- Analyze-on-save workflow with optional automatic dashboard opening
- Activity Bar dashboard, status bar command, editor title action, context menu action, and Command Palette commands
- Terminal CLI for scripting, CI checks, JSON output, Markdown reports, and platform comparison

## Safety Model

Struct Scope provides rule-based suggestions only. It does not rewrite source code automatically, execute generated code, fetch remote rules, or call model APIs. Every recommendation is returned with `safe: true` and `auto_apply: false`; the user remains responsible for deciding whether a layout change is compatible with ABI, serialization, protocol, or public API requirements.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.85 or newer
- Python 3.8 or newer
- `pip`
- Node.js and npm for development, testing, or packaging

Install Python dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r python/requirements.txt
```

## VS Code Usage

Open a supported C, C++, header, or Rust source file. Struct Scope can be invoked through:

- File save when `structscope.analyzeOnSave` is enabled
- `StructScope: Analyze Struct` from the Command Palette
- `Ctrl+Shift+M` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+M` on macOS
- The Struct Scope status bar item
- The editor title action or editor context menu
- The Struct Scope Activity Bar dashboard

The dashboard renders the selected structure as a byte map, field table, metrics panel, rule insights panel, cache-line ruler, and reorder suggestion panel. The platform selector can be changed manually. The Detect control re-runs host ABI detection and refreshes the layout.

## Terminal Usage

Analyze a source file:

```sh
python python/cli.py tests/fixtures/v2_local_demo.c --platform x86_64
```

Filter output to one struct:

```sh
python python/cli.py tests/fixtures/v2_local_demo.c --platform x86_64 --struct TelemetryPacket
```

Print rule guidance only:

```sh
python python/cli.py tests/fixtures/v2_local_demo.c --platform x86_64 --struct TelemetryPacket --rules-only
```

Compare target platforms:

```sh
python python/cli.py tests/fixtures/v2_local_demo.c --compare x86_64 arm32
```

Emit JSON or Markdown reports:

```sh
python python/cli.py tests/fixtures/v2_local_demo.c --platform auto --json
python python/cli.py tests/fixtures/v2_local_demo.c --platform x86_64 --markdown
```

Example local C output:

```text
TelemetryPacket: total=40B padding=18B (45.0%) optimal=24B savings=16B
CacheSplitDemo: total=68B padding=0B (0.0%) optimal=68B savings=0B
warning: Field value straddles cache line boundary
```

## Configuration

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `structscope.pythonPath` | Optional Python executable path for the analysis backend |
| `structscope.defaultPlatform` | Default ABI platform: `auto`, `x86_64`, `arm64`, `arm32`, `avr`, or `riscv32` |
| `structscope.cacheLine` | Cache-line size in bytes: 32, 64, or 128 |
| `structscope.analyzeOnSave` | Runs analysis when supported files are saved |
| `structscope.autoOpenPanel` | Opens the dashboard automatically during save-triggered analysis |
| `structscope.showStatusBar` | Shows or hides the Struct Scope status bar command |

## Supported Inputs

Languages:

- C structs
- C++ structs and classes with data members
- Rust structs

ABI platforms:

- `x86_64`
- `arm64`
- `arm32`
- `avr`
- `riscv32`

The `auto` platform option detects the host ABI. Cross-compilation targets cannot be inferred reliably from source text alone, so embedded and firmware projects should select the intended target ABI explicitly.

## Architecture

Struct Scope is split into a TypeScript VS Code extension and a Python analysis backend.

- `src/extension.ts` manages VS Code commands, diagnostics, status bar state, Activity Bar entries, the webview, and the Python child process.
- `python/server.py` exposes newline-delimited JSON-RPC over stdio.
- `python/cli.py` provides terminal access to the same analysis pipeline.
- `python/parser_c.py` and `python/parser_rust.py` extract structure definitions with tree-sitter.
- `python/layout_engine.py` computes ABI layout with deterministic alignment arithmetic.
- `python/analyser.py` and `python/rules_engine.py` compute waste, cache-line risks, layout grade, and safe guidance.
- `python/platforms.py` contains ABI tables and host platform detection.
- `webview/` contains the local dashboard UI assets.

No source code is sent to cloud services, telemetry endpoints, compiler services, third-party analysis systems, or model APIs.

## Development

Run tests:

```sh
pytest tests/ -v
python tests/test_server_integration.py
```

Run TypeScript checks and build:

```sh
npx tsc --noEmit
npx esbuild src/extension.ts --bundle --platform=node --external:vscode --outfile=out/extension.js
```

Package the extension:

```sh
npx @vscode/vsce package
```
